# Codeforces
# ⚔️ Codeforces Practice Solutions

## 📌 Overview

This repository contains my personal solutions to **Codeforces** problems.  
I use this repo to:
- Practice **competitive programming**
- Prepare for **contests** and **interviews**
- Keep a record of all solved problems, organized by difficulty and tags

---

## 🔍 Platforms & Tags

Codeforces problems are often categorized by:
- Difficulty Ratings (800 to 3500+)
- Tags like: `greedy`, `dp`, `math`, `dfs`, `binary search`, `two pointers`, etc.

---

## 💻 Languages Used

- C++ (Main language used in contests)
- Python (coming soon for selected problems)

---


```

> 🔖 Each folder contains `.cpp` files named after the problem title or contest ID.

---

## 🚩 How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/DeshratnaBharti/Codeforces-Solutions.git
cd Codeforces-Solutions
```

2. Browse through folders based on contest type or division (Div2, Div3, etc.)

3. Open any `.cpp` file to read the solution with comments.
